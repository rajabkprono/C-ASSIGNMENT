Importance of OOP in Software Development
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is essential in software development as it enhances modularity, reusability, maintainability, and scalability. By organizing code into classes and objects, OOP simplifies code management, debugging, and collaboration. Key benefits include:

Code Reusability: Inheritance allows the reuse of common functionalities, reducing redundancy.
Data Security: Encapsulation protects sensitive data by restricting direct access.
Flexibility: Polymorphism enables dynamic method overriding, allowing different behaviors for different object types.
Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by exposing only necessary details to users.
By following OOP principles, software systems become more efficient, easier to maintain, and adaptable to future changes.

Future Recommendations for Improvement
To enhance the employee management system further, the following advanced OOP concepts can be implemented:

Use of Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

Convert Employee into an abstract class with a pure virtual method for displayDetails().
This enforces consistency and ensures that derived classes implement specific functionalities.
Implementation of Design Patterns:

Factory Pattern: Create a Factory class to handle object creation dynamically.
Singleton Pattern: Ensure only one instance of the EmployeeManagementSystem exists.
Integration with a Database:

Instead of storing employee data in memory, use a database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for persistent storage.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee records.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Develop a user-friendly GUI using frameworks like Qt or wxWidgets for better interaction.
Exception Handling:

Implement error handling to manage invalid inputs, missing data, and duplicate IDs.
